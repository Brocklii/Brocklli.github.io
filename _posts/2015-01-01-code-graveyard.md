This is my collection of all my old coding projects from college that were so small or long ago that I can't really remember them to much. Because of this they will likely have no description but some may have a small description because I was really into the project or it made me cry and gave me headaches, haha! Feel free to browse around and copy paste them into your IDE or text editor to play around with and try to get it running. I make no promises these work out of the box because the Computer Science Department was very particular they wanted things to run on their machines and for their classes. Anyways, I hope you enjoy :)
