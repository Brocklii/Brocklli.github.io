This project is currently in progess.

This project was something I got very interested in a long time ago when I was first getting into smart tech. I started to get the ball rolling on completing the project in the middle of the summer in 2021. I got all the parts for the project except the mirror glass, monitor, and wood materials. The biggest hold up for this project was price. I didn't just want this to be some project that got completed and then became a trophy on a wall. I wanted this to be useful every day. There is some use in the project if I set this to be touch screen as central smart home control panel. But that really increases the price.

Unfortunately, at the time I can't get the materials due to stock shortage and my own time being short. I do hope to finish the project one day at a more affordable time with more useful features I can add. As for the tutorials I found a lot of neat videos online, but the one that stuck out to me that I was ready to follow step by step and modify afterwards will be linked below. If you have any suggestions or want to try to work on this together, I would be interested to work something out or if there's other projects you want to work on, I am all for it!
