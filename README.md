## Brock Kaess

Hello! My name is Brock Kaess and I am a software engineer specializing in machine learning and artificial intelligence with a minor in mathematics. I'm currently pursuing my bachelors in computer science at Colorado State University and will be graduating in Fall 2022. This website is all about me as a professional with a touch of personal insights and hobbies. In summary I have a wide range of interests and hobbies. I've been interested in all things computer and technology related as long as I can remember. I'm a smart home enthusiast since I was 16 years old, put together project with raspberry pi's such as a pi-zero ad-blocker, home assistant, homebridge, and hoobs server setups, and front and back end experience in web development. I also enjoy spending my free time playing games (mostly Rocket League), listening to music, catching up on the latest shows, hanging out with friends, and going to do anything outdoors from fine dining and walking around the town with some tea too hiking trails in the mountains. I'm also a huge animal lover and don't know where i would be without my best friend who has a whole page about her here.
