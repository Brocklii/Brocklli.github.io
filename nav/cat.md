Welcome to the page dedicated to my cat, Ayana. She is very famous online for my profile pictures of her. The most famous being the one where she is gazing out an apartment window next to a snake plant while wearing the cutest tie by Pusheen I got at PetCo. Unfortunately, at the time of writing it has been lost and they no longer sell it. I'm keeping my eyes peeled though.

I adopted Ayana through my local rescue shelter Fort Collins Cat Rescue which has since renamed itself to Animal Friends Alliance. I got here through a foster home that was run through their website. This was my second but technically first time adopting a cat, more on that in a bit. When I came to college and had to find a place to live after my first year in the dorms, I knew I was going to bring up my cat from back home. Unfortunately, she didn't adjust to apartment life to well and was stressing her out. I regret not realizing it sooner, but I came to terms with it that I had to give my lifelong friend back to my parents. She deserved to be outdoors bathing in the sun like she was so fond of. Her name is Tigress which I got the name from Kung Fu Panda, which was the name of the Tiger character which had bright piercing green eyes just like this cute Kitty. Everyone called her Kitty though and so it just kind of stuck. She was actually my first adoption, though it was much less formal being that I found her through my dad neighbor which had a big litter. I got her sometime around December 2007 and so now she is about 14 years old. You can see some pictures of her (Kitty/Tigress) here.

So that kind of gives some background to my childhood cat and how she was my first adoption but less formal. When it came time to give Kitty back to my parents and get a new cat, I knew this was going to have to be done right, and that I couldn't just pick the first cat I saw. But that's what happened. When I saw the first picture of Ayana on the website and got in touch with the owner who sent me more, I just fell in love with her and her sister, Luna. Ayana, as well as Kitty, are a short hair breed and Luna was a long hair. I know that I didn't want a long hair because I am slightly allergic to cats, and I don't like having cat hair all over which long haired cats are known for making a big mess of hair. Though I gave Luna the benefit of the doubt because her and her sister were just so damn cute! I finally got to see both of them in person and play with each of them. I had a hard time deciding. They both had just gotten their shots, so they weren't as energetic, but they seem to have bounced back well. Luna was being extremely playful while Ayana, which was named Aspen at the time, was playful but also sleepy and cuddly. And that's exactly what I was looking for. I talked it over with my mom on the phone, had a hard time agreeing to only getting one and not both. But I got the paperwork done quickly, on I believe February 17th in 2019, and came back as soon as they let me to get Aspen/Ayana. And the rest is history. She was born on 11/30/2018 and so at the time of writing she is just under three years old. She is used to apartment life, and I don't see me letting her outside until I have a steady career and a good house with a yard. That will be a lot of fun. But she seems to enjoy bird and people watching from windows and chasing my roommate’s cat up and down the stairs. And quiet often we bring over my girlfriends’ cat and they are just the best of friends. Funny enough my girlfriend loved the name Aspen and so named her kitty that. Aspen is obviously the name of a tree which is actually one of my favorites, and the name Ayana was one I had to do some digging for. I originally wanted to find a name online that started with the letter 'K'. But I eventually found Ayana and feel in love with its sound and meaning. Ayana is Cherokee, which my dad's side of the family is, and it means Blossom Tree/blossoming/eternal flower. So, it's kind of funny that Ayana still kept a name that can refer to or is inspired by a tree and her best friend is Aspen. I will link photos of Ayana and Aspen below. Ayana is a very unique and funny cat that is so adorable and cute. She is very special to me and being that her picture I use on all my accounts is so popular online and in class (because quarantine had us in MS Teams) I felt she deserved a page on my website as well as Kitty and Aspen. I also thought this would be fun to look back on in the future as well as many of my other pages, almost like a blog and insight into my life, rather than just a portfolio that is bland and to the point. I hope you enjoy :)
