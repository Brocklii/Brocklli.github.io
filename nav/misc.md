    This is a page dedicated to music I have produced. I only made three songs, and they are fire (if fire is hot trash). I thought it was fun and wish I would have stuck with it but apparently geometry homework was more pressing. I hope you do enjoy!

    <em>(Sidenote: There's a weird glitch last I checked in which the link shows a very small image of the video. just click it and it will resize to a proper percent of the screen and start playing :)</em>
